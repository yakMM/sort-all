# Sort-all

Sort _\_all__ lists alphabetically.

**Disclaimer**: This is a fork from  https://github.com/aio-libs/sort-all for my own usage.

## Differences with the original project:

- Now take directory names instead of file names and apply the fix on all .py files found recursively.
- Now read files as text instead of binary so that platform-dependant separators are properly handled.
